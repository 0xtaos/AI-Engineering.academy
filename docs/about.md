### Who am I?

Hi there, I am Adithya S K, a 20-year-old AI enthusiast. I have been working with AI systems for over a year now, engaging in various projects from training and finetuning models (LLMs) to implementing sophosticated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines in production.&#x20;

**I've often been asked about the best free resources to get started with AI, and I found it challenging to give a definitive answer.**

With AI Engineering Academy, I aim to:

1. Provide a structured and well-thought-out path for beginners in AI.
2. Emphasize applying AI knowledge by creating projects.

### What to Expect?

Each chapter in AI Engineering Academy will include the following:

* A 5 to 15-minute video covering code and concept overviews, answering mainly three questions:
  * why you should learn it
  * How it will be usefull
  * what is the most optimal way to implement it\

* The most updated code examples.
* Links to additional resources for deeper dives into the topics.
