## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base. This approach enhances the quality and accuracy of generated responses by grounding them in specific, retrieved information.

This notebook aims to provide a clear and concise introduction to RAG, suitable for beginners who want to understand and implement this technology.

- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning concepts

## Notebook Contents

Our notebook is structured into the following main sections:

1. **Environment Set Up**: We'll guide you through setting up your Python environment with all the necessary libraries and dependencies.

2. **Data Ingestion (Chunking)**: Learn how to prepare and process your data for use in a RAG system, including techniques for breaking down large texts into manageable chunks.

3. **Prompting**: Understand the art of crafting effective prompts to guide the retrieval and generation process.

4. **Setting up Retriever**: We'll walk you through the process of setting up a retrieval system to find relevant information from your knowledge base.

5. **Examples with Retrievers**: Explore practical examples of using retrievers in various scenarios to enhance your understanding of RAG systems.
